# Advent of Code 2022 solutions

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Some notes:

- I add the solution to a problem here once the leaderboard for that problem gets full.
- I execute my solutions in the command line using `<execute program> < input.txt > output.txt`. For example, I do `python3 main.py < input.txt > output.txt` to run my Python solutions.
